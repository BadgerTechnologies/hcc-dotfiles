       |       |       | When ssh'd, put remote host name in status line?
       |       |       |     Although, maybe not. If remote is running tmux, it will have a status line of its own.

To Do:
 * x Port >, <, break-pane and join-pane implementations from hope's current session
   * http://superuser.com/questions/470130/tmux-prompt-to-select-window-for-join-pane-while-still-seeing-window-numbers-an
 * choose-buffer
   * list buffers, select one to copy to X clip board & to default buffer, so can paste with ] (?)
   * list buffers, select one to save to file (prompt for filename)
   * list buffers, select one to paste immediately
 * environment
   * Propagate DISPLAY variable
   * Get ssh agent working on remote session?
   * zsh function to manually reload env
   * zsh auto-reload periodic?
 * Improve status window notifications/color
   * Change active from red to bright white
   * Make shell error prompt turn it red?
   * Make normal shell prompt and/or inactivity do something, as clue command is done
   * Clear the above two when select the window
   * Status bar tips (?): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9628435/tmux-status-bar-configuration
 * What is terminal-overrides option?
 * What is prefix2? Can I use it to easily address windows > 9?
   * A: Sadly, No. It's just an alias for prefix, so can't behave differently :(
 * Why does X clipboard not work across ssh when DISPLAY is right? Seems DISPLAY Not propagate into run-shell?
 * Quick mouse-mode toggle (not needed?): http://tangledhelix.com/blog/2012/07/16/tmux-and-mouse-mode/
 * vim + tmux integration: http://thedrearlight.com/blog/tmux-vim.html
 * vim: folding via grep
 * vim: Get rid of ^a.  Maybe make it equiv to ^w, for pane switching similar to tmux?
 * vim: Get mouse to work within terminal
   * In tmux
   * Through ssh?







Nested sessions:
• Enter pass-through mode:
∘ un-binds all "non-escaped" bindings
∘ Changes the escape to ^e
∘ Adds a "PASS" tag to the status line (maybe left side?)
